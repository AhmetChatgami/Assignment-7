 - What is JSX, and why is it used?
 Ans: It is a JavaScript  syntax extension where we can write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript files.

 - What is the difference between State and Props?
 Ans: State comes inside from the component which can load data, and Props passed into the component from the parent component.
 
 - What is the useState hook, and how does it work?
 Ans: The useState hook is a special function that allows to add state to functional components in React. When we call an useState hook it returns an array with two items- count & setCount.

 - How can you share state between components in React?
 Ans: In React, data flows down from parent to child using props. The main way to solve this is through a pattern called State Lifting.

 - How is event handling done in React?
 Ans: Event handling in React is very similar to HTML & JavaScript, but there is a few differences. For event handling we use camelCase for handling like onClick instead of onclick. We pass a function reference as the event handler, not a string onClick={handleClick} instead of onClick="handleClick()".
